## About

This repository contains all information, files, and explanations regarding my build of a simple(?) modular lunetta-synthesizer-pattern-generator-logic-machine built using mostly CD4000 series CMOS digital logic chips, sometimes in linear or irregular way to create classic (or not so classic) synthesizer circuits & modules.

Although most of these circuits are pretty simple, this is a ambitious project and meant for people who have at least decent knowledge of electronics and some prior project experience, particularly with stripboarding.

What is a Lunetta!? - Stanely Lunetta was an expirimental musiscian who is thought to be the first to popularize using cheap digital logic chips to create abstract avant garde drones, sequences, and the like. Thus lunettas are electroncis instruments and tools created using (mostly) digital logic chips.

This project is a way for me to increase my synth diy knowledge and experience with a large scale project requiring planning, designing, building, finishing, trouble shooting, and more, at a larger scale, to ready myself for all the more complex full-diy analog modular synth world.

## Modules

* [L000 - Power](https://github.com/ckarcz/Modular-Lunetta/blob/master/L000-Power/) - Quad rail power supply, panel, and bus.
* [L001 - Static](https://github.com/ckarcz/Modular-Lunetta/blob/master/L001-Static/) - Simple 'static' logic (high/1/+5V and low/0/-5V).
